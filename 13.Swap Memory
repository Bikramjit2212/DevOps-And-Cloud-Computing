Swap memory, also known as swap space, plays a crucial role in managing system memory, particularly during periods of high memory usage. It serves as an overflow area on a hard disk or SSD where inactive data from RAM can be temporarily stored.
●This allows the operating system to continue functioning even when physical RAM is fully utilized.
Role of Swap Memory:
●Virtual Memory Extension
●Memory Management
●System Stability
Its Impact on performance during high memory usage:
During high memory usage, swap memory significantly impacts system performance in several ways:
●Performance Degradation
●Disk I/O Bottlenecks
●Fragmentation Issues
●Insufficient Swap Space Risks
