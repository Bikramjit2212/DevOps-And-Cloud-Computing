  -resource allocation

  user creation:
  command: adduser -> used to create a new user in a user-friendly manner
  eg: sudo adduser roy
  this setsup a new user roy and sets up a home directory at /home/roy
  to see the users: cat /etc/passwd [this will show all the users & ls doesnt works here]

# when you create user by default it is added into one group which is same as username
# called Primary Group
# bob:x:1002:1002::/home/bob:/bin/sh
# means bob is the user
# 1002 is user ID, 1002 is Group ID, /home/bob: is the Directory, /bin/sh is default shell

# Update password
sudo passwd bob
# enter the password , reenter and update

usermod -> modifies existing user accounts. can change attributes like group membership or home directories.
#user Mod Giving administrative Permission
sudo usermod -aG sudo bob
this adds bob to the sudo group granting administrative privileges.

# change Directory
sudo usermod -d /new/home/directory bob

# Change Shell
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash bob

# change comment (Full name of User)
sudo usermod -c "John Doe" bob

how to manage groups:
command: groupadd
//creates new group in system
eg: sudo groupadd devs
this creates new group named devs

to check list of groups:
getent groups

to check particular group:
getent group developers

groupmod -> modifies an existing group attributes such as name or GroupID [GID]
eg:sudo groupmod -n team devs
//will change the group from devs to team
//change a user,s group membership, use 'usermod' command again, ensuring to use '-a' option when adding them to additional groups.
remove user from specific group, you typically need to specify their newgroup membership without including the group you want to remove them from.

groupdel -> deletes an existing group from the system
eg: sudo groupdel devs

adding user to a group
sudo usermod -aG developers bob

creating new user and assigning groups:
sudo useradd -g staff -G devs, test cktutorials
//this creates the user 'cktutorials' with 'staff' as the primary groupand adds them in 'developers & 'test" groups

verify user Groups [viewing group membership]
groups bob [groups username]
//this lists all groups associated with specified user.
