methodology that integrates dev&ops teams to improve software delivery and operations efficiently.

3 fundamental principles:
-Continious integration & continious deployment [CI/CD]
-collaboration
-automation

1.CI/CD:
a. CI:
practice of frequantly merging code changes into a shared repo: involves: 
-automating integration
-automatic build
-rapid test to understand the integration issues
-continious feedback
-ci server
To catch integration bugs early and ensure that the codebase is always in a working state
b. CD:
takes CI a step further by automating the release process. includes:
-automation
-reliability and stability
-feedback and monitoring
-efficiency and speed
To ensure that software can be released to production quickly and reliably.
CD builds upon CI by automating the deployment of the tested code to the target environment

2.COLLABORATION:
heart of DevOps emphasizing need for seamless communication between dev & ops team.
promotes a culture where development and operations teams work together throughout the entrire software life cycle fostering communication and shared responsibility for outcomes.

3. AUTOMATION:
critical priinciple to reduce manual effort and streamline the process. automating repetative tasks like testing, deployment and infrastructure management for speeding up the process and reducing human error.
