AGILE METHODOLOGIES:
prject management framework that breaks into smaller, manageable phases known as sprints. this iterative approach allows teams to adapt changes quickly & continious improvements
=Agile Manifesto Values:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contact negotiation
responding to change over a following plan
these values promote a collaborative environment where teams can respond effectiely to changes and deliver values effectively.

SCRUM FRAMEWORK:
one of the most popular agile frameworks, particularly suited for projects with rapid changes
=roles:
product owner
scrum master
development team
=ceremonies:
sprint planning
daily scrum
sprint review
sprint retrospective
=Benefits of SCRUM:
encourages regular feedback from stakeholders
increases transparency and accountability among team
facilitates continious improvement through retrospectives

KANBAN FRAMEWORK:
another method focusing on visualizing and managing workflow efficiently.
-visual management
-work in progress(WIP)
-limits continious delivery
=benefits:
-enhances visibility of work processes and bottlenecks
improves efficiency by limiting WIP and focusing on task completion.
offers flexibility in prioritizing tasks without fixed iterations.

CASE STUDY TO COMPARE WATERFALL AND AGILE OUTCOMES:
SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT:
Project Background: A software development company was tasked with
creating a new customer relationship management (CRM) system. The
project was initially planned using the Waterfall methodology, but after
encountering significant challenges, the team transitioned to Agile.

Waterfall Approach
Process: The project followed a linear sequence: requirements gathering,
design, implementation, testing, and deployment.
Outcomes:
  ● Missed Deadlines
  ● User Dissatisfaction
  ● Limited Flexibility

Agile Approach
Process: After recognizing the limitations of Waterfall, the team adopted
Agile practices, working in iterative sprints with continuous stakeholder
feedback.
Outcomes:
  ● Improved Collaboration
  ● Faster Delivery
  ● Higher Quality Product

WATERFALL:
  rigid; dificult to implement
  limited to initial & final phase
  longer due to sequential phase
  low satisfaction, final product did not meet expectations
  increased costs due to late changes
AGILE:
  highly adaptable;welcomes changes
  continious involvement throughout the project 
  faster due to iterative sprints
  high;regular feedback ensured alignment
  better cost control through incremental delivery

= Emphasizing iterative progress, flexibility, and stakeholder involvement in Agile
ITERATIVE PROGRESS:
refers to practice of breaking down the development process into small, manageable increments or iterations (often called sprints in scrum). each iteration results in a potentially shippable product increment
=benefits:
  frequent delivery
  continous feedback
  risk mitigation

FLEXIBILITY:
allows teams to adapt to changing requirements and priorities throughout dev.crucial for fast paced businesses.
benefits:
  ● Responsive to Change
  ● Prioritization of Features
  ● Enhanced Innovation
  
STAKE HOLDER INVOLVEMENT:
active stakeholders such as customers, end-users, and business representatives is cornerstone of agile methodologies.
=benefits:
  ● Alignment with User Needs
  ● Increased Satisfaction
  ● Collaborative Problem Solving
