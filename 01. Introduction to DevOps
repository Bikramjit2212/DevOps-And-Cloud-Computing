Developer + Operations =  DevOps
Dev = Plan, Create, Test, Bundle - For Every Requirement in Development
Ops = Release, configuration, monitor
DevOps is a methodology that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration, streamline processes, and improve the efficiency of software delivery.
This approach aims to improve and shorten the systems development lifecycle, fostering a culture of collaboration between traditionally siloed teams

DevOps lifecycle
1. continious development
2. continuous integration
3. continuous testing
4. continuous deployment
5. continuous monitoring
6. continuous feedback
7. continuous operations

These 7 steps are iterative process for rapid delivery of high quality software

The DevOps lifecycle is a series of automated development workflows that operate within an iterative cycle to optimize rapid delivery of quality software.
The DevOps lifecycle (sometimes called the continuous delivery pipeline, when portrayed in a linear fashion) is a series of iterative, automated development processes, or workflows, run within a larger, automated and iterative development lifecycle, designed to optimize the rapid delivery of high-quality software.
