# Difference Between Continious Delivery & Continious Deployment

## Continious Delivery

software development practice where code changes are automatically
built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. However, the deployment to production is done manually.

### Characteristics:

1. Automated Testing: Continuous Delivery involves extensive automated testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests) to ensure that the code is always in a deployable state.
2. Manual Approval: Even though the code is ready for deployment at any time, the actual release to production requires manual approval or triggering. This step allows teams to review and decide when to
release the new code.
3. Release on Demand: With Continuous Delivery, the software can be released to production at any time. This allows for flexibility in deciding when to push new features or updates live.
4. Pipeline Integration: The Continuous Delivery pipeline integrates various stages of the development process, from code commit to production readiness, ensuring a consistent and reliable release process.

### Benefits:

1. Flexibility: Teams can choose the most appropriate time to deploy, aligning releases with business needs 
2. Control: Manual approval adds an extra layer of control, which can be important for critical or large-scale deployments. 
3. Reduced Risk: Because the code is always in a deployable state, the risk of introducing bugs in production is minimized.

**Example**
A team working on a financial application uses Continuous Delivery. The code passes all automated tests and is ready for production, but the team waits until a scheduled maintenance window to manually deploy the changes

# Continuous Deployment (CD)

extension of Continuous Delivery where every code change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production, without requiring manual approval.

### Key Characteristics

1. Fully Automated Pipeline: Continuous Deployment takes automation further by removing the manual approval step. Once the code passes all tests, it is automatically deployed to production.
2. High Frequency of Releases: Continuous Deployment allows for rapid, frequent releases to production, sometimes multiple times a day. This is particularly useful in environments where continuous updates are
beneficial, such as web services or SaaS platforms.
3. Immediate Feedback: Changes are immediately reflected in production, providing real-time feedback and allowing for quick iterations based on user input or monitoring data.
4. Robust Monitoring: Continuous Deployment requires robust monitoring and alerting systems in place to detect and respond to any issues that arise after deployment

### Benefits

1. Speed: Continuous Deployment maximizes the speed of delivering new features, bug fixes, and improvements to users.
2. Efficiency: It eliminates the bottleneck of manual approval, making the release process more efficient
3. Continuous Innovation: Teams can continuously innovate and release new features, staying ahead of competitors.

Example
A team developing a social media platform uses Continuous Deployment. Each new code commit that passes automated testing is deployed directly to production, allowing users to immediately experience new features and updates

## Key Difeerences

| Aspect | Continuous Delivery | Continuous Deployment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deployment Trigger | Manual Approval required before production deployment | Automatic deployment to production without manual intervention |
| Deployment Frequency | Deployment is flexible, controlled by the team | Deployment is continious and frequent, often multiple times a day |
| Release Control | Teams have control over when to deploy | Deployment is automatic, with less manual control |
| Use Case | Suitable for environemnts requiringmanual checks or compliance requirements | Ideal for environments that benefit from rapid and frequent updates, like SaaS or web platforms |
| Risk Management | Allows for additional manual checks and risk assessments before deploying | Requires strong automated testing and monitoring to mitigate risks in real-time |
| Complexity | Generally simpler to implement due to manual control points | requires a more advanced, fully automated pipeline with robust testing and monitoring |

3. Artifact Management: Store and manage build artifacts using tools like Artifactory or Nexus
4. Automated Deployment: Deploy applications to staging or production environments automatically or with manual approval gates

# GitLab CI

GitLab CI is a robust and integrated continuous integration and delivery tool that's part of the broader GitLab platform. It allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipelines directly from your Git repository.

## Key Concepts:

### Pipelines

A pipeline in GitLab CI consists of a series of stages that define the lifecycle of a CI/CD process (e.g., build, test, deploy).
Pipelines are defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file located in the root directory of your repository.
Each pipeline can run multiple jobs in parallel or sequentially, depending on the configuration.

### Jobs

Jobs are individual tasks within a stage, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying to a server
Jobs run in a specified environment (e.g., Docker container) and can be configured with different parameters like scripts, artifacts, and tags.

### Stages

Stages organize jobs within a pipeline. Jobs in a stage run concurrently, and the next stage begins only when all jobs in the current stage have completed successfully.
Common stages include build, test, and deploy, but you can customize stages to suit your workflow.

### Runners

GitLab Runners are agents that execute the jobs defined in your pipeline. They can run on various environments, such as virtual machines, Docker containers, or Kubernetes clusters
Runners can be shared (available for all projects) or specific (dedicated to a particular project or group).

### .gitlab-ci.yml File

This file is the heart of GitLab CI, where you define the pipeline structure. Here's a simple example:

```bash
stages:
 - build
 - test
 - deploy
 
build-job:
	stage: build
	script:
	 - echo "Compiling the code"
	 - gcc -o myapp main.c
 
test-job:
	stage: test
	script:
	 - echo "Running tests..."
	 - ./myapp --test
	 
deploy-job:
	stage: deploy
	script:
		- echo "Deploying the application..."
		- scp myapp user@server:/path/to/deploy
	only:
		- main
```

### Key Features

Built-in CI/CD within the GitLab ecosystem
Pipelines as code (using .gitlab-ci.yml)
Supports Docker and Kubernetes integrations
Security testing and monitoring within CI/CD.

# Spinnaker:

Spinnaker is a powerful, open-source continuous delivery platform that focuses on automating and managing the deployment of applications across various cloud environments.

6. Notification and Reporting
CI systems provide notifications (via email, Slack, etc.) and reports on build and test results, keeping teams informed of code status, failures, and successful deployments.
7. Writing Tests for CI, Pipelines, and Workflow
Writing automated tests for the CI pipeline ensures every code change is verified. Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests are integrated into workflows to validate functionality and stability.
8. Different Types of Environments (Beta, Gamma, Prod, Testsuite, OneBox)
**Beta/Gamma**: Pre-production environments for testing features with limited users.
**Prod (Production)**: The live environment where end-users interact with the application.
**Testsuite**: Automated testing environment for running tests.
**OneBox**: A single-instance environment used for testing by developers or for isolated builds.
9. CI Best Practices and Optimizatio
Best practices include frequent commits, fast feedback loops, parallel testing, proper test coverage, and minimizing flaky tests. Optimizing CI involves reducing build time, automating as much as possible, and
ensuring tests run efficiently.

# What is Continuous Deployment?

Continuous deployment (CD) is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production once they have been tested and approved. CD involves using automation to deploy code changes to production environments as soon as they are ready.
The CD is important because it enables organizations to deliver software faster and more frequently. With CD, code changes can be deployed to production quickly and efficiently, reducing the risk of human error and delays.

1. Faster Time to Market:
- **Immediate Release**: CD enables teams to deploy new features, bug fixes, and improvements to users as soon as they are ready. This rapid deployment capability is essential for businesses that want to stay
competitive and respond quickly to market demands
- **Reduced Lead Time**: By automating the deployment process, CD reduces the time between writing code and getting it into the hands of users, significantly accelerating the development lifecycle.
2. Enhanced Quality and Stability:
- **Automated Testing**: CD pipelines are typically equipped with a suite of automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. These tests ensure that only code that passes all quality checks is deployed, reducing the risk of introducing bugs into production.
- **Frequent, Smaller Updates**: With CD, updates are smaller and more frequent, which makes it easier to identify and fix issues. Smaller changes are less likely to cause major disruptions, leading to more stable
releases
3. Continuous Feedback and Improvement:
- **Real-Time User Feedback**: CD allows for immediate feedback from users after deploying new features. This feedback can be quickly incorporated into subsequent releases, enabling continuous improvement
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: CD often integrates with monitoring tools that track the performance and behavior of the application in production. This data provides insights that can be used to enhance future updates.
4. Reduced Human Error
- **Automation of Repetitive Tasks**: CD automates repetitive deployment tasks that are prone to human error, such as configuring environments, managing dependencies, and running tests. This reduces the likelihood
of mistakes and ensures consistency across deployments
- **Eliminating Manual Processes**: By removing manual steps, CD minimizes the risk of errors associated with manual interventions, such as incorrect configuration settings or missed deployment steps.
5. Improved Collaboration and DevOps Culture
- Alignment with DevOps Principles: CD aligns with DevOps practices by fostering a culture of collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders. It encourages shared ownership of the code,
where everyone is responsible for the success of the deployment process
- Continuous Integration and Delivery: CD works hand-in-hand with Continuous Integration (CI), where code is frequently merged into a shared repository and automatically tested. This synergy promotes a more integrated and collaborative development environment.
6. Scalability and Flexibility:
- Handling Growth: As applications and user bases grow, CD allows for the scalable deployment of updates across multiple environments and regions. Automated deployment pipelines can handle the complexities of deploying to large, distributed systems.
- Flexibility in Deployment Strategies: CD supports various deployment strategies, such as blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rolling updates, giving teams the flexibility to choose the best approach
for their specific needs.
7. Improved Security:
- Security Integration: CD pipelines can integrate security testing and validation steps, ensuring that security checks are automatically performed before code is deployed. This reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities reaching production
-Compliance: Continuous deployment can help maintain compliance with regulatory requirements by ensuring that all deployed code has passed the necessary security and compliance checks.

# Setting Up a CI Pipeline

Setting up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline involves automating the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and potentially deploying applications. Below is a general guide to setting up a CI pipeline using common CI tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or CircleCI.

## 1. Define your project requirements

1. Version Control System (VCS): Ensure your project is under version control (e.g., Git) and hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Dependencies: List all dependencies your project requires to run (e.g., libraries, packages)
3. Build and Test Commands: Define the commands needed to build and test your project.

## 2. Choose a CI Tool

1. **Jenkins**: Ideal for complex, customizable pipelines with various plugins
2. **Travis CI**: Great for simple setups, especially with GitHub integration
3. **CircleCI**: Best for fast, efficient pipelines with advanced Docker support

## 3. Setup the CI Tool

A. Jenkins
1. Install Jenkins
Download and install Jenkins on your local machine or server
Access Jenkins via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) after installation.
2. Create a New Pipeline
From the Jenkins dashboard, click on “New Item” and select “Pipeline.
Name your pipeline and configure the source code repository (e.g., GitHub repository).

1. Configure Pipeline
Use the “Pipeline” section to define the stages of your CI process. This can be done via a Jenkinsfile or
directly in the UI
    
    Example Jenkinsfile:
    
    ```bash
    pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
    stage ('Build'){
    steps{
    echo 'Building..'
    }
    }
    stage('Test'){
    steps {
    echo 'Testing..'
    }
    }
    stage ('Deploy'){
    steps{
    echo('Deploying....')
    }
    }
    }
    }
    ```
    

## 4. Trigger Builds:

Set up triggers to run the pipeline automatically on code commits or pull requests. Jenkins supports various triggers, including polling the SCM and webhooks from GitHub

## 5. Run & Monitor:

Manually trigger a build to ensure everything works. Monitor the build logs and results directly in Jenkins

B. Travis CI

1. Sign Up and Link Repository
Sign up on the Travis CI website and link your GitHub repository.
2. Create a .travis.yml File
Add a .travis.yml file to the root of your repository to define the pipeline.
Example .travis.yml :
    
    ```bash
    language: python
    python: 
    	- "3.8"
    install:
    	- pip install -r requirements.txt
    script:
    	- pytest #replace with your test command
    ```
    
3. Push Changes
Commit and push the `.travis.yml` file to your repository. Travis CI will automatically start building and testing your project based on this configuration.
4. Monitor Builds
View the build results on the Travis CI dashboard, and fix any issues that arise.

C. Circle CI

1. Sign Up and Link Repository
Sign up on the CircleCI website and link your VCS repository.
2. Create a .circleci/config.yml File
In your repository, create a .circleci directory and add a config.yml file
Example config.yml
    
    ```bash
    version: 2.1
    
    #Define the jobs we want to run for this project
    jobs:
    	build:
    		docker:
    			- image: cimg/base:2023.03
    		steps:
    			- checkout
    			- run: echo "this is the build job"
    		test:
    			docker:
    				- image: cimg/base:2023.03
    			steps:
    				- checkout
    				- run: echo "this is the build job"
    		
    		#orchestrate our job run sequence
    		workflows:
    			buid_and_test:
    				jobs:
    					- build
    					- test
    ```
    
3. Push Changes
Commit and push the config.yml file. CircleCI will automatically start the pipeline when changes are detected.
4. Monitor Builds
Use the CircleCI dashboard to view the build process and results.

# Building & Testing Code

Bash scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Unix-like operating systems.

1. Writing a Simple Bash Script
A basic Bash script typically consists of a series of commands that you would normally run in the terminal.
Here’s a simple example:
    
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #a simple script to greet the user
    
    echo "Enter Your Name:"
    read name
    echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to Bash Scripting
    ```
    
2. Making the Script Executable
Once you've written your script, you need to make it executable. This is done using the chmod command

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

now you can run the script by typing:

```bash
./script.sh
```

1. Testing the Script
Testing in Bash can be as simple as running the script and checking its output. However, for more complex
scripts, you might want to test specific functions or parts of the script.
    
    
    Example of a Simple Test:
    If your script has a function, you can test it like this:
    

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#A function to add two numbers
add() {
	echo $(($1 + $2))
}
#Test the add function
result=$(add 2 3)
if [ "$result" -eq 5 ]; then
	echo "test passed"
	else
	echo "test failed"
fi
```

1. Debugging Bash Scripts
If something goes wrong, you can debug your Bash script by using the -x option
    
    ```bash
    bash -x script.sh
    ```
    

This will print each command and its result as the script runs, which helps in identifying where the script is failing.

Examples of a Basic Script with Testing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#A simple script to demonstrate a basic function and testing
#Function to add two numbers
add_numbers(){
local num1=$1
local num2=$2
echo $((num1 + num2))
}

#testing the function
test_add_numbers() {
local result
result=$(add_numbers 2 3)

if [ "$result" -eq 5 ]; then
echo "test passed"
else
echo "test failed"
fi 
}
#run the test
test_add_numbers
```

This script includes a function to add two numbers and a basic test to check if the function works correctly.
When you run the script, it will tell you if the test passed or failed

# Summary on Jenkins

1. Jenkins Architecture
Jenkins follows a master-agent architecture. The master manages the build process and orchestrates agents. Agents perform the actual execution of builds and tasks. This setup ensures scalability and distributed workload handling.
2. Files, Plugins, Jobs (Upstream & Downstream)
Files: Jenkins uses configuration files (like config.xml) for jobs and builds
Plugins: Jenkins supports numerous plugins to extend functionality, like Git, Docker, or Slack integrations.
Jobs: Jobs are tasks Jenkins runs. Upstream jobs trigger other jobs, while downstream jobs are triggered by upstream jobs upon completion.
3. Jenkins Installation
Jenkins can be installed on various platforms, using methods like installing from a `.war` file, native packages (e.g., for Ubuntu), or using Docker.
4. Jenkins Integration with GitHub
Jenkins integrates easily with GitHub, allowing automatic triggering of builds when changes are pushed to a GitHub repository. This is achieved using webhooks and the Git plugin in Jenkins.
5. Build Triggers and Scheduling
Build triggers define when a Jenkins job should run. You can set up manual triggers, GitHub webhooks, or schedule builds using a cron-like syntax for periodic execution.
6. Jenkins Installation
Jenkins installation is straightforward, supporting many platforms and methods (via .war file, packages, or Docker). After installation, configuration happens through a web interface

# Summary on Performance Testing

1. Load Testing Tools (JMeter, Gatling, Locust, etc):
-JMeter: An open-source load testing tool for measuring the performance of web applications, APIs, and services. It simulates multiple users, supports various protocols (HTTP, FTP, etc.), and provides comprehensive reports
-Gatling: A powerful tool for load and stress testing, especially for web applications. It’s written in Scala and offers high scalability and detailed metrics with a user-friendly web interface 
    
    -Locust: A Python-based load testing tool that allows you to define user behavior in code. It’s ideal for testing how many concurrent users a system can handle by simulating thousands of users.
    
2. Stress Testing and Soak Testing:
-Stress Testing:
Tests the system beyond its normal capacity to identify breaking points or system limits. The goal is to see how the system behaves under extreme conditions, such as high traffic or resource exhaustion
Soak Testing:
Tests system performance over an extended period to check its stability and reliability. It focuses on detecting memory leaks, performance degradation, or other long-term issues that may arise after prolonged use.
3. Performance Testing in CI/CD Pipelines:
Integrating performance testing into CI/CD pipelines helps catch performance bottlenecks early. This process ensures that new code changes do not degrade system performance. It usually involves:
1. Running automated performance tests (e.g., load or stress tests) after every build or deployment
2. Setting up threshold limits so that the pipeline fails if the performance degrades beyond acceptable levels
3. Using tools like JMeter, Gatling, or Locust integrated with CI tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI.
4. Performance Testing Best Practices
    
    -Start Small: Begin with baseline tests and gradually increase the load to simulate real-world scenarios
    -Use Realistic Data: Ensure test data resembles production data to simulate real conditions
    -Test Early and Regularly: Integrate performance testing into development and CI/CD cycles to catch issues early
    - Monitor System Resources: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage during tests to identify bottlenecks
    - Simulate Peak Load and Stress Conditions: Include stress tests to check system resilience under peak loads
    - Analyze Results Thoroughly: Investigate response times, error rates, throughput, and resource consumption to understand performance behavior
    

# Summary on Security Testing

1. Static Code Analysis Tools
- SonarQube: A widely used tool for continuous code quality inspection, SonarQube detects bugs, security vulnerabilities, code smells, and technical debt in multiple programming languages. It integrates with CI/
CD pipelines to enforce code quality standards
- Fortify: A security-focused static analysis tool that scans code for vulnerabilities, ensuring applications are secure by identifying issues like buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS). It supports
multiple languages and integrates well into DevSecOps workflows
- Checkmarx: Another popular static code analysis tool that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle. It integrates with development environments and CI/CD pipelines.
2. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
-DAST: A method of testing web applications and APIs by simulating real-world attacks while the application is running. Unlike static analysis, DAST doesn't require access to the source code but interacts with the app from the outside to find security issues such as SQL injection, XSS, and authentication flaws. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite are commonly used for DAST.
3. Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking:
-Penetration Testing (Pen Testing): A manual or automated process where security professionals simulate attacks on a system to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious hackers. It typically
includes network, application, and physical security testing
-Ethical Hacking: A broader practice that involves using hacking techniques to test and improve the security of systems and applications in a legal and authorized manner. Ethical hackers find and fix vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
4. Security Testing in CI/CD Pipeline:
Integrating Security Testing in CI/CD: Security tests, including static code analysis (SAST), dynamic analysis (DAST), and vulnerability scanning, are integrated into CI/CD pipelines to detect security issues early in the development process. Automated security tools (like SonarQube or Fortify) scan code and environments at every stage of development to ensure that vulnerabilities are identified before deployment.

# Summary on Testing Frameworks & Practices

1. Importance of Tests and Types of Testing
-Importance of Testing: Testing ensures software quality, identifies bugs early, and maintains system stability. It helps developers verify that their code behaves as expected, reducing the risk of defects in production. Automated testing improves efficiency, consistency, and reliability over manual testing.
-Types of Testing:
>Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation, ensuring they work as expected
>Integration Testing: Verifies the interaction between different modules or services to ensure they function correctly together.
>Regression Testing: Ensures that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality
>System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole to ensure it meets the specified requirements
>Acceptance Testing: Validates the system against business requirements, often performed by end users or stakeholders
2. Unit Testing Frameworks
-JUnit: Popular for testing Java applications, providing annotations and assertions to simplify unit testing 
-pytest: A widely used Python testing framework that supports simple test cases and fixtures, along with advanced testing needs
-RSpec: A testing tool for Ruby, known for its human-readable syntax and behavior-driven development (BDD) style
-Jest: Used primarily for testing JavaScript and React applications, offering built-in coverage reporting and mocking features.
3. How to Choose a Testing Framework
Consider the following factors:
    
    -Language Compatibility: Choose a framework that supports your programming language (e.g., pytest for Python, JUnit for Java)
    -Community and Ecosystem: Look for active communities and rich plugin ecosystems for better support and flexibility
    -Ease of Use: A simple and intuitive framework can reduce setup time and improve productivity
    -Test Coverage and Performance: Frameworks with built-in test coverage and performance optimization are useful for large-scale applications
    -Integration with CI/CD Tools: Ensure the framework integrates well with your CI/CD pipelines and DevOps practices
    

4. Writing Unit Tests with One Framework (Example: pytest)

```bash
#install pytest
pip install pytest

#code to test (example:math_operations.py):
def add (a, b):
	return a+b
def subtract (a, b):
	return a-b
	
#Test File (test_math_operations.py):
from math_operations import add, subtract

def test_add():
	assert add(2, 3) == 5
	assert add(-1, 1) == 0
	
def test_subtract():
	assert subtract(5, 2) == 3
	assert subtract(3, 3) == 0
	
#run tests:
pytest
	
```

 This test ensures that the add and subtract functions behave as expected.

# Summary on Integration Testing

1. Integration Testing Frameworks (Selenium, Cypress, etc)
-Selenium: A popular tool for automating web browser testing. It supports multiple programming languages (Java, Python, C#, etc.) and browsers, making it ideal for end-to-end and integration tests in web
applications
-Cypress: A modern web testing framework, known for its fast setup and intuitive interface. It provides automatic waiting, real-time reloads, and can run integration tests directly in the browser
-TestNG: A Java testing framework that supports integration testing, unit testing, and functional testing with robust test configuration options
-Postman: Mainly used for API integration testing. It allows users to test RESTful APIs through an easy-to-use interface and supports automation of requests.
2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
a. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
A development methodology where tests are written before the code itself.
-Steps
Write a failing test
Write the minimal code to pass the test
Refactor the code for optimization
-It improves code quality, forces developers to think about edge cases early, and ensures high test coverage
    
    b. Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
    An extension of TDD that focuses on the behavior of the application rather than its implementation
    Tests are written in plain language that non-developers (e.g., business stakeholders) can understand
    Tools like Cucumber and RSpec are often used to write these human-readable scenarios
    

example: 

given the user is on th login page

when they enter valid credentials

then they should be redirected to the dashboard

# Summary on Continuous Deployment (CD)

1. Importance of CD
CD ensures that code changes are delivered to production reliably and quickly. It helps teams deliver features faster, improves product quality, and reduces risks by automating and streamlining the process from code to deployment.
2. Differences Between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment
Continuous Delivery (CD): Code changes are automatically tested and prepared for release to production. However, manual approval is required before deployment
Continuous Deployment: Every change that passes automated tests is automatically deployed to production without human intervention.
3. CD Tools
Jenkins: An open-source automation server widely used for building, testing, and deploying software
GitLab CI: Integrated within GitLab, providing CI/CD pipelines, including testing, code quality checks, and deployments
Spinnaker: Multi-cloud deployment tool enabling release management and orchestration for complex pipelines.
4. Deployment Strategies
Blue/Green Deployment: Two identical environments are set up (Blue and Green). The traffic is switched between environments when releasing new versions, reducing downtime
Canary Deployment: A small portion of traffic is routed to the new release, with gradual rollout based on the success of the initial batch
Rolling Deployment: New versions are rolled out incrementally across servers, reducing downtime while ensuring continuous availability.
5. Automated Testing and Monitoring
Automated tests (unit, integration, regression) ensure that code changes are reliable, while monitoring helps track performance, health, and errors in production to ensure smooth operations.
6. Deployment Pipeline
A deployment pipeline automates the workflow of building, testing, and deploying applications. It typically involves stages like build, test, staging, and production.
7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It enables modular, reusable, and maintainable code through key principles:
-Encapsulation: Bundling of data and methods within objects
-Inheritance: Deriving new classes from existing ones
-Polymorphism: Methods that behave differently based on the object
-Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details from the user.
8. Deployment Automation and Orchestration
Automation ensures code can be deployed with minimal human intervention, while orchestration coordinates and manages complex deployments across multiple environments or servers.
9. CD Best Practices and Optimizatio
-Use small, incremental changes
-Ensure code is always in a deployable state
-Automate tests and deployments
-Implement monitoring and alerting
-Optimize pipelines for speed and reliability by parallelizing tasks and reducing manual steps.
10. Release Management and Approval
Even with CD, some teams maintain manual gates for critical releases. A well-defined release management process ensures approvals, compliance checks, and feature management before deploying to production.
