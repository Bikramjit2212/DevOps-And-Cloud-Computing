TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data packets. It is widely used in applications requiring high reliability.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol):A connectionless protocol that allows fast data transmission without ensuring delivery or order. It is suited for applications where speed is more critical than reliability.

ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):Primarily used for network diagnostics and error reporting rather than for direct data transmission.

APPLICATIONS OF PROTOCOL:
1. TCP Applications:
●Web Browsing
●Emails
●File Transfers

2. UDP Applications:
●Streaming services
●Online Gaming
●VoIP

3. ICMP Applications:
●Network Diagnostics
●Error reporting

TCP: Guarantees reliable, ordered delivery of data.
UDP: Fast, but doesn't guarantee delivery or order.
ICMP: Used for network diagnostics and error reporting.
