IP ADDRESS:
IP addresses are unique identifiers assigned to devices on a network, enabling them to communicate with each other. They are essential for routing data across the internet or local networks.
IP Address Structure:
●IPv4
●IPv6
Simple Examples:
●IP Address: 192.168.1.10
●Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
●Network Portion: 192.168.1
●Host Portion: 10

SUBNETTING:
Subnettingis the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets). This helps improve network performance and security by isolating traffic and controlling access.
Subnet Mask: A subnet mask defines which part of an IP address is the network portion and which part is the host portion.
●Network Portion: 192.168.1
●Host Portion: .1 (indicating this specific device)
Subnetting:
Like dividing a large group into smaller, organized groups.
Subnets:
The smaller, organized groups created by subnetting.
Subnet Mask:
A code that tells computers which part of their address identifies the group they belong to, and which part identifies the individual computer within that group.
Network Portion:
The part of the computer address that identifies the group.
Host Portion:
The part of the computer address that identifies the individual computer.
IP Address:
The complete address of a computer on a network.
