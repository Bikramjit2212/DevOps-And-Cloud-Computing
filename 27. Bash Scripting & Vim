```

```bash
mv *.txt ../folder2/ #any file that ends with * should be moved to folder 2
```

### to rename a file

```bash
mv file1.txt something.txt #we can use mv to rename the file name & is not going to change any content inside it

## VIM [vi improved]

first you need to install vim → https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-vim-editor-in-ubuntu/

vim is a text editor 

to start editing a file → 

```bash
vim file1.txt #enables the text editor to write 
press esc + : + w + q #to exit & go back to terminal
```

### Modes of VIM

1. normal mode [default mode] - can do copy, paste, delete
2. insert mode → edit text, (press i → normal/default to insert mode) [to esc → esc + w+ q]
3. visual mode → select the text (press v → normal to visual mode) (to select press shift + arrow btn to select)
4. command mode → (first press esc btn then “press : +w+q”)

we cant directly paste in vim by using ctrl+v from clipboard 

to paste it we need to use “+p” and it will paste from the clipboard

to learn vim using a game play “vim adventures”

to delete the whole line altogether press esc btn first then press “dd” → it deletes the whole line
