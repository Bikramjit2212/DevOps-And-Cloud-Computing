Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.
How it works:
● When a process is executed, its pages can be loaded into any available page frames in physical memory, allowing non-contiguous allocation.
● The operating system maintains a page table for each process, which maps logical pages to physical page frames. This table helps in translating logical addresses into physical addresses.

Segmentation is another memory management technique that divides the logical address space of a process into variable-sized segments based on the logical structure of the program, such as functions, arrays, or objects.
How it works:
● Each segment has a name and a length, and the logical address consists of a segment number and an offset within that segment.
● The operating system maintains a segment table for each process, which contains the base address and length of each segment.
