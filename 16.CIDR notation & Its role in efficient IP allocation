CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for allocating and routing IP addresses that improves the efficiency of IP address usage.
CIDR Notation: Its consists of an IP address followed by a slash (/) and a number that indicates the number of bits in the network prefix. For example, in the CIDR notation 192.168.1.0/24:
●
192.168.1.0 is the network address.
●
/24 indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, leaving 8 bits for host addresses.

Imagine instead of having fixed-size neighborhoods, we have flexible ones.

Old Way (Classes): Everyone had the same size neighborhood, even if they didn't need it. This wasted a lot of addresses.
New Way (CIDR): We can make neighborhoods any size we want, based on how many houses are needed. This saves addresses.
CIDR Notation: It's like a short way to write the address and tell how big the neighborhood is.

Address/Number:
The address tells you where the neighborhood starts.
The number tells you how many houses are in the neighborhood.
Example: 192.168.1.0/24

192.168.1.0: This is the starting address of the neighborhood.
/24: This means the first 24 parts of the address are the same for everyone in the neighborhood. The last 8 parts can be different for each house.
Why is this better?

Saves Addresses: We don't waste addresses on neighborhoods that are too big.
More Efficient: It makes the internet work better.
In short:

CIDR lets us create neighborhoods of any size for computers on the internet.
The "address/number" tells us where the neighborhood is and how big it is.

Role in Efficient IP Allocation:
1.Flexible Addressing
2.Aggregation
3.Efficient Use Of IP Space
4.Simplified Management
